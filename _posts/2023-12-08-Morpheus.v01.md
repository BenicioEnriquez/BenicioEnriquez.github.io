I'm happy to announce the first demo of project Morpheus!
All lot of work has been done building a base to work with the ONNX models,
in hopes to build a robust multiplatform engine for neural rendering.
Here's a little sneak peak at what's to come:

## Tech Stack (for now)
 - Latent Consistency Models
 - Custom ControlNet using depth + material mask
 - ONNX inference engine + vectorized scheduler
 - Olive/AIMET compute graph optimizations
 - Model quantization + Hardware neural engine
 - Optical Flow estimation + frame interpolation (think DLSS)

## Current Progress
 - Conversion to ONNX (done)
 - Custom C++/C# pipeline (done)
 - ControlNet mods (done)
 - DirectX 12 support (done)
 - CUDA support (done)
 - TensorRT support (in progress)
 - Model quantization + fine tuning (in progress)
 - Optical Flow estimation + frame interpolation (not started)
 - Custom ControlNet using Multimodal Material Segmentation (not started)
